# Robust_Convex_Clustering_with_Median_of_Means
Codes for the paper "Convex Clustering Redefined: Robust Learning with the Median of Means Estimator".

Instructions : 
#1. The folder "real_testing" contains codes for algorithms to be run on real datasets. They include the links to the real datasets. They output a file that contains a sequence of ARI, AMI, and the estimated number of clusters for the dataset. These are useful for various tests and error rates provided in the main paper and the appendix.

#2.  The folder "synthetic_testing" contains codes for algorithms to be run on real datasets. They include the links to the synthetic datasets. They output a file that contains a sequence of ARI, AMI, and the estimated number of clusters for the dataset. These are useful for various tests and error rates provided in the main paper and the appendix.
